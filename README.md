**About Foxnews:** Foxnews is a US based news website, where everyone can get to know about the latest as well as old news with complete brief. Also the news are distributed into different types.

**Project Description:** The goal of project is to use Drupal CMS to design a Foxnews website clone. The site is more than 26 years old and implementing every feature is not a feasible thing. So, we did decide to develop most common pages involved in general or everyday purpose webstes.

**The Pages Implemented includes:**

1) Homepage
2) Detailed Page
3) Search Page
4) Login Page

**Some of the dynamic things or integrations with other web services includes:**

1) Login with Facebook
2) Login with Google
3) Newsletter
